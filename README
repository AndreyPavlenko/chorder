This script reads a VDR channels.conf form standard input or file and orders

Usage: chorder [options] [template]

OPTIONS:
   -x <expr>    Regular expression mathing channels that should be excluded.
   -X <file>    File with channel exclude expressions (one per line).
   -f <decl>    This option allows to override a channel's fields.
                <decl> - semicolon separated fields declaration expressed in 
                Perl language. The following example overrides the CA field if 
                the channel's provider is HTB+:
                -f '$f10 = ($f2 eq 'HTB+') ? '500,5601' : $f10'
   -F <file>    File with channel field override expressions (one per line).
   -i <file>    Read the specified input file instead of stdin.
   -o <file>    Write to the specified output file instead of stdout.
   -d <file>    Write debug messages to the specified file instead of sterr.
   -t <file>    Template file.
   -v           Verbose mode - print debug information.
   -h           Print help.
